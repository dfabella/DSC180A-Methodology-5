# Hello World!

## Welcome to Methodology Assignment 5, Task 2

My name is *Daphne Fabella*.
- contact: dfabella@ucsd.edu

I am in *Section A09* and my mentor is *Gabriel Riegner*.

### Brainstorming Prompts
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we covered in our domain this quarter was about how autocorrelation within brain regions could be explained by their function. For example, the autocorrelation functions for the regions of the brain responsible for processing more complex stimuli, like *actively* listening to a professor's lecture, were noticably different than the autocorrelation functions for the regiond of the brain responsible for processing passive stimuli, such as the ever-changing white noise in a coffee shop.

- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project is studying autocorrelation of regions of the brain that are more associated with emotional regulation to see if those functions have their own distinct features.

- **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I would make to the current Quarter 1 Project is placing more emphasis on understanding the how the math used to process and interpret fMRI data, such as PCA, ICA, and correlation, maps to higher-level concepts. Our first quarter focused a lot on techniques and I feel like I didn't get to build a strong intuition about how and when to use them.


- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in how Machine Learning can contribute to understanding Functional Connectivity of the brain. I would also be interested in further exploring PCA and ICA since we focused much more on correlation.
