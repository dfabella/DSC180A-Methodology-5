# Hello World!

## Welcome to Methodology Assignment 5, Task 2

My name is *Daphne Fabella*.
- contact: dfabella@ucsd.edu

I am in *Section A09* and my mentor is *Gabriel Riegner*.

### Brainstorming Prompts
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic we covered in our domain this quarter was how autocorrelation within brain regions could be explained by their function. For example, the autocorrelation functions of brain regions responsible for processing more complex stimuli, like *actively* listening to a professor's lecture, were noticably different from the autocorrelation functions of brain regions responsible for processing passive stimuli, such as simply *hearing* ever-changing white noise in a coffee shop.

- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project is understanding emotional regulation from a neuroscience level. To do this, we could capture the autocorrelation functions for brain regions linked to emotional regulation and compare them to those of other regions. Then, we could assess any distinct characteristics in the autocorrelation functions for emotional-regulation related brain regions to gather insight about how we process our emotions.

- **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I would make to the current Quarter 1 Project is dedicating more time to gaining a deeper understanding of how mathematical techniques like PCA, ICA, and correlation, used in processing and interpreting fMRI data, relate to higher-level concepts. Our first quarter focused a lot on interpreting functional connectivity as a math problem, but I didn't get to build a strong intuition about how and when to use the relevant formulas when given a specific task to complete.


- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in how Machine Learning can contribute to understanding Functional Connectivity. I would also be interested in further exploring PCA and ICA since we focused more on pairwise correlation of time series.
